      { "q": "Do I need to install an app?", "a": "No app required. You scan a QR code at the counter and your stamps are saved to your phone's browser wallet." },

      { "q": "What if I switch or lose my phone?", "a": "Use the same email or phone number and your stamps sync back. No account passwords needed." },
      { "q": "Is my data private?", "a": "Yes. We only store what's needed to track your stamps. No location tracking, no resale of personal data." },
      { "q": "Does it work at different stores?", "a": "Yes. gobonki works at cafés, barbers, restaurants—each business can have its own card and rewards." },
      { "q": "Does it work offline?", "a": "You can open your card offline, but stamping/redeeming requires a quick online check to prevent fraud." }

    "businesses": [
      { "q": "How long does setup take?", "a": "About 2 minutes. Create a card, set your reward, print your QR. That's it—no POS integration required." },
      { "q": "Do I need new hardware?", "a": "No. Any phone or tablet that can open a browser works. Staff just scans or taps the customer's QR." },
      { "q": "How are stamps validated?", "a": "QR + server checks prevent duplicates. Optionally require staff PIN or device approval for extra control." },
      { "q": "Can I customize rewards and branding?", "a": "Yes. Set stamp count, reward text, brand colors and even whitelabel on paid tiers." },
      { "q": "What about pricing?", "a": "Start free. Paid features like whitelabel and analytics are optional and transparent—no transaction fees." },
      { "q": "Does it integrate with my POS?", "a": "Not required. If you want POS sync, we offer a simple export and REST API on higher tiers." }
